#Project 9 Group

- We have created a file including all the five scoring functions to evaluate all 1000 song lyrics by comparing the words with pre-created word lists. We listed gre txt for complexity evaluation, bad words txt for kid_safe evaluation, and several lists for love and mood evaluation. To evaluate the length of the lyrics file, we used 300 words as an upper benchmark and than normalized the output between 0 and 1.
 Then we created a test file to make sure all the functions run with no error and the results are reasonable.
